# ImpossibleRescue
Impossible Rescue is a 2D platformer where the player controls Shadow, a drone hacking a mainframe to retrieve a powerful stolen AI. Solve puzzles and gain new movement abilities to progress through all six levels but be careful about the mainframe defensive measures.

This project was developed by a team of three programmers using Coco2d-X framework and C++ as part of my MSc Video Game Developer course at Birmingham City University. Classes folder contains my personal contribution to the project.
